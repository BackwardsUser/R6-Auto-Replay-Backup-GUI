# Automatic Match Replay Backuper

This application will automatically back up Rainbow Six Siege Match replays.
I made this because Rainbow Six Siege will delete the replays after it reaches 10 matches.

This application was coded with electron.js
https://www.electronjs.org/

### You will not get banned for this
This application doesn't attach to the Rainbow Six Process, so you don't need to worry about getting a hit from BattlEye.
 
 
 Don't feel obligated to download this, I coded this because I kept forgeting to backup my Replays.
 
 # Disclaimer
 Any of your backed up saves may be lost in future updates, delete the old saves when a new season comes out until they fix their replay feature to support older replays

If you would like to download this and compile it yourself (for whatever reason) Use the MAIN branch, Use the other branches at your own risk.
