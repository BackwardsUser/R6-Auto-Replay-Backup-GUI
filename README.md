# Automatic Match Replay Backuper

This application will automatically back up Rainbow Six Siege Match replays.
I made this because Rainbow Six Siege will delete the replays after it reaches 10 matches

This application was coded with electron.js
https://www.electronjs.org/

### You will not get banned for this
This application doesn't attach to the Rainbow Six Process, so you don't need to worry about getting a hit from BattlEye.
 
 If you want the built version of this application, you can download it here:

 Don't feel obligated to download this, I coded this because I kept forgeting to backup my Replays.
 
 # Disclaimer
 Any of your backed up saves may be lost in future updates, delete the old saves when a new season comes out until they fix their replay feature to support older replays
